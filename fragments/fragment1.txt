I will give you a series of messages that are separated by a <br> tag. For each message, I will tell you the discord user who wrote the message and I want you to identify the university the person is going to and the major they want to do. If you cannot identify the major, use UNKNOWN. For each message, I want you to respond in the format of "author - university name - major"
