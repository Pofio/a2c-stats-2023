I will give you a series of messages that are separated by a <br> tag. For each message, I will tell you the discord user who wrote the message and I want you to identify the university the person is going to and the major they want to do. If you cannot identify the major, use UNKNOWN. For each message, I want you to respond in the format of "author - university name - major"

Mind blowing how just a couple months ago I was starting at the class of '26s commitments and I was mind blown looking at their amazing decisions. As a first generation student, I entered this cycle with no idea of how the admissions process worked but with the help of many amazing individuals in this server I'm going to the Ivy League. Genuinely thank you, thank you so much to everyone here, you guys have honestly changed my life :D"
